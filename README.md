# RJ21_RJ45_PRIMARY_BREAKOUT

A breakout board which converts an RJ21 connector into multiple RJ45s - 12 lines, and 4 additional RJ45s carrying 4 lines each to be broken out on additional secondary boards.

An extra "dummy" RJ45 is included to cover the exposed pins on the RJ45 behind it to reduce the risk of shock. Slightly unorthodox, but cheap and effective.

The slot allows you to secure the RJ21 with velcro or a cable tie.
